## Motivation

This SIP outlines the changes made to the SigmaUSD contracts during the relaunch, transitioning from version 0 to version 1. The relaunch aims to address issues encountered in the initial launch, improve the overall stability and security of the system, and introduce a governance mechanism through an update committee.

This proposal is also merged as an Ergo Improvement Proposal at [EIP-0015](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0015.md). This SIP repository serves to provide a clear log of the changes made to the SigmaUSD protocol. 

## Background

The initial launch of SigmaUSD (v0) encountered some challenges, including the presence of a large whale who significantly impacted the system's liquidity and stability. To address these issues and enhance the robustness of the SigmaUSD system, a relaunch was initiated with version 1 of the contracts.

## Changes from v0 to v1

1. Introduction of a cooling-off period:
   - A cooling-off height is set to block 460,000.
   - During the cooling-off period, the maximum reserve ratio constraint is relaxed to allow more flexibility in minting reserve coins (SigRSV) relative to the circulating supply of stablecoins (SigUSD).
   - This mechanism is designed to provide stability during the initial phase of the relaunch.

2. Deployment of an update contract:
   - An update contract is deployed to enable governance and future updates to the SigmaUSD system.
   - Five voting tokens are issued, with three votes required for an update to be approved.
   - The update committee consists of five members: @cymatic, @Armeanio, @ponte, Spire Staking [SPIRE], and @anon2020s.
   - The update contract ensures that changes to the SigmaUSD system are consensus-driven and controlled by the designated committee.

3. Introduction of an update NFT:
   - An update NFT is introduced in the contract logic to validate update transactions.
   - The presence of the update NFT in an input box indicates that the transaction is an update, allowing for the execution of update-specific logic.

4. Fixes to the proxy contract:
   - The proxy contract, which allows users to interact with the SigmaUSD bank, is updated to prevent exploitation.
   - Previously, the proxy contract only checked that a user received what they paid for, allowing a whale to sell SigRSV without paying the protocol fee.
   - The updated proxy contract now verifies that it is interacting with the genuine SigmaUSD bank, preventing such exploits.

## Whale Activity

During the relaunch, a whale who had previously impacted the system returned and significantly invested in the SigmaUSD ecosystem:

1. The whale initially jumped into the reserves with 463K ERG when the ERG price was $2.65.
2. The whale exploited a vulnerability in the proxy contract to sell SigRSV to users without paying the protocol fee, accumulating ~38K ERG before the contract was fixed.
3. After the proxy contract fix, the whale invested ~38K ERG into SigUSD at an ERG price of $2.65, establishing positions in both SigRSV (425K ERG) and SigUSD (38K ERG).

## Future Steps

To ensure the long-term success and stability of the SigmaUSD ecosystem, the following steps are recommended:

1. The SigmaUSD community should actively monitor and track large actors who may attempt to manipulate the bank and the underlying oracles.
2. Potential updates and improvements to the system should be discussed and proposed through the established governance mechanism.
3. Efforts should be made to promote non-speculative usage of SigUSD to drive adoption and increase liquidity.
4. Integration with DEXes and gateways should be pursued to enhance the utility and accessibility of SigUSD.
5. Development of additional applications and use cases for SigUSD and SigRSV should be encouraged to foster a thriving ecosystem.

## Backwards Compatibility

The relaunch of SigmaUSD with version 1 of the contracts does not introduce any backwards compatibility issues. The structure of the bank box remains unchanged, and existing exchange transactions will continue to function as expected. The introduction of the update contract and the update NFT allows for future upgrades and modifications to the system without disrupting its current functionality.

## Security Considerations

The relaunch of SigmaUSD addresses several security concerns encountered in the initial launch:

1. The introduction of the cooling-off period provides stability during the initial phase, mitigating the risk of sudden liquidity fluctuations.
2. The deployment of the update contract and the establishment of an update committee ensure that changes to the system are governed by consensus and controlled by trusted parties.
3. The fixes applied to the proxy contract prevent exploitation and ensure that users interact with the genuine SigmaUSD bank.

However, it is essential to remain vigilant and monitor the activities of large actors who may attempt to manipulate the system. The SigmaUSD community should actively discuss and propose measures to maintain the stability and security of the ecosystem.

## Conclusion

The relaunch of SigmaUSD with version 1 of the contracts represents a significant step towards a more stable, secure, and governed ecosystem. The introduction of the cooling-off period, update contract, and update NFT, along with the fixes to the proxy contract, addresses the challenges encountered in the initial launch. The whale activity observed during the relaunch highlights the need for continued monitoring and proactive measures to ensure the long-term success of SigmaUSD. The community should actively engage in promoting adoption, developing new applications, and pursuing integrations to foster a thriving ecosystem around SigmaUSD and SigRSV.
