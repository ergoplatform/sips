## Motivation

This SIP proposes an update to the SigmaUSD contracts deployed on the Ergo blockchain to enable per-oracle-epoch minting limits while also removing redundant code for the the cooling off period mechanism that was used during the initial launch phase. The goal is to enhance system stability by limiting the amount of SigUSD and SigRSV that can be minted within each oracle update cycle and to simplify the contract by removing redundant code.


## Proposed Changes

1. **Remove the cooling off period parameter and associated logic**:
   - Remove the `coolingOffHeight` constant and any code branching based on it.
   - ***Explanation:*** The current SigmaUSD system uses a cooling off period mechanism, which was designed for the initial launch phase. During this period, the maximum reserve ratio constraint was relaxed, allowing for more flexibility in minting reserve coins (SigRSV) relative to the circulating supply of stablecoins (SigUSD). However, after the launch phase, this mechanism becomes redundant and can be removed to simplify the contract and eliminate potential confusion or unintended behavior.

2. **Add two new registers to the bank box to track per-oracle-epoch minting limits**:
   - `R6`: `Int` - Last oracle update height 
   - `R7`: `(Long, Long)` - Remaining limit for SigUSD and SigRSV minting per oracle update
   - ***Explanation:*** These new registers allow the contract to enforce minting limits within each oracle update cycle. `R6` stores the height of the last oracle update, while `R7` holds the remaining minting limits for SigUSD and SigRSV. These limits are reset to a percentage of the current reserves whenever a new oracle update occurs.

3. **Modify the exchange logic to enforce the per-epoch (12 minutes) minting limits**:
   - Check if the current oracle update height differs from the value in `R6`.
   - If they differ, reset the minting limits in `R7` to **0.5% of the current reserves**.
   - For SigUSD minting, decrement `R7._1` by the minted amount and ensure it remains non-negative.
   - For SigRSV minting, decrement `R7._2` by the minted amount and ensure it remains non-negative.
   - Store the updated minting limits in the output bank box at `R7`.
   - Add a `properLimit` condition to ensure the updated limits are correctly propagated and non-negative.
   - ***Explanation:*** These changes enforce the per-oracle-epoch minting limits. Whenever a new oracle update occurs, the minting limits are reset based on a percentage (0.5%) of the current reserves. During SigUSD or SigRSV minting, the corresponding limit is decremented, and the contract ensures that the limits remain non-negative. The `properLimit` condition verifies that the updated limits are correctly propagated to the output bank box.

The rest of the contract logic, including fee calculation, exchange equations, and validity checks, remains the same as in the original contract.


## Example

Let's consider a scenario where the current reserves in the bank box are 1,517,662.73 Erg, and the oracle price of SigUSD is 2.22 SigUSD per Erg.

Given:
- Current reserves: 1,517,662.73 Erg
- Oracle price: 2.22 SigUSD/Erg

The per-oracle-epoch minting limits would be calculated as follows:
- Minting limit = Current reserves × 0.5% = 1,517,662.73 Erg × 0.005 = 7,588.31365 Erg

This means that within each oracle update cycle, the maximum amount of SigUSD and SigRSV that can be minted is limited to 7,588.31365 Erg worth of tokens.

At the price of 2.22 SigUSD per Erg, this translates to:
- Maximum SigUSD minting limit = 7,588.31365 Erg × 2.22 SigUSD/Erg = 16,846.06 SigUSD

Therefore, in this scenario, the maximum amount of SigUSD that can be minted within an oracle update cycle is approximately 16,846.06 SigUSD, and the corresponding limit for SigRSV minting would be 7,588.31365 Erg.

## New Bank Contract Script

The proposed changes can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/kushti/3f34ed7d70cc6919c29f5bc65772b02e) (main changes are lines 75-94)

```scala
{
      // this box
      // R4: Number of stable-coins in circulation
      // R5: Number of reserve-coins in circulation
      // R6: Last oracle update height (to have limits per cycle)
      // R7: Remaining limit for SigUsd and SigRSV minting per oracle update

      // -- snipped --

      val limitFactor = 200 // 1 / 200, so 0.5% per oracle update
      val limitsReg = bankBoxIn.R7[(Long, Long)].get
      val limits = if (bankBoxIn.R6[Int].get != oracleUpdateHeight) {
        val limit = bankBoxIn.value / limitFactor
        (limit, limit)
      } else {
        limitsReg
      }

      val updLimits = if (scExchange && scCircDelta > 0) { // SC mint
        (limits._1 - bcReserveDelta, limits._2)
      } else if (rcExchange && rcCircDelta > 0) { // RC mint
        (limits._1, limits._2 - bcReserveDelta)
      } else {
        (limits._1, limits._2)
      }

      val properLimit = (updLimits._1 >= 0 && updLimits._2 >= 0) &&
                        (bankBoxOut.R7[(Long, Long)].get == updLimits)

      // -- snipped --
  
      sigmaProp(isExchange || isUpdate)
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This upgrade should be backwards compatible, as it does not change the structure of the bank box or the behavior of existing exchange transactions. New bank boxes created after the upgrade will have the additional registers and enforce the per-epoch minting limits, while old bank boxes will continue to function as before. The removal of the cooling off period should not affect the compatibility of the contract, as it was only relevant during the initial launch phase.

## Security Considerations

The introduction of per-oracle-epoch minting limits enhances the stability and security of the SigmaUSD system by preventing excessive minting of SigUSD or SigRSV within a single oracle update cycle. This mitigates potential vulnerabilities or attacks that could exploit the minting process.

The removal of the cooling off period should not introduce any security risks, as it was primarily intended for the initial launch phase and is no longer necessary for the ongoing operation of the system.

The rest of the contract logic, including the exchange equations, reserve ratio checks, and token conservation, remains intact, ensuring the overall security and integrity of the SigmaUSD system.
